## To run:
1. Make sure python 3 is install (I have not tested with python 2)
2. Download repo
3. Enter directory
4. Run `python ezCurator.py technology`
5. Open `curated.html` in a web browser.

Make sure to replace `technology` with the topic of your choice.

### If running on your own Linux Server:
Make sure to install the pip modules in the following manner:
- `sudo -H pip3 install language_tools`
- `sudo -H pip3 install beem`

## Future Plans:
* Web app version:
  * Choose topic via radio button
  * Vote via SteemConnect
  * Add choice to use Steemit or Busy
* General:
  * Faster content word count

## To Dependencies:
- java and JDK (for grammar checker)
- pip packages
  - [language-check](https://pypi.org/project/language-check/)
  - [beem](https://beem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
